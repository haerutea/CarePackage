This Android app is written in Java, using Firebase Authentication and Firebase Database.

As an IB student, we noticed that people around us are often stressed due to the crushing pressure from academic works, co-curricular activities, extra-activity activities. 
We are also aware of the increasing number of students suffering from mental illnesses due to high stress levels and even resulting in several Hong Kong students committing or attempting suicide in recent years.

To combat this problem charities like Samaritan Befrienders of Hong Kong provide men and women with an avenue to talk, since they are less willing because of pride and the elderly are visited by volunteers who will show them care. 
However, there are less opportunities for students to have counseling outside of school therapists. 
There are mental health apps targeted towards general healthcare in the market; however, we have yet to come across one that are suited to students.

CarePackage is a 3-in-1 mental health care package app: includes chat function, a to-do list and a mood tracking and analysis function.
All three functions were developed separately, then combined together into one app.  The combining process was done by Tsz Yan.

#### Chat Function: (developed by Tsz Yan)
The chat will act as a bridge for users to communicate with others users about their mental state.  
Due to the different preferences, users will be matched with others with similar preferences, for example content and age group.  
To preserve privacy, the chat log will be deleted immediately once both users exit the chat lobby, unless a user requests to keep the chatlog.  
Users can also save or unsave certain messages they like by simply tapping on the message.

#### To-do list Function: (developed by Allyson)
The app is made to provide incentives for people who suffer from mental health issues to become more productive by creating a game/simulation that sends notifications to the user. 
The user can set items on a to-do list that the game tracks. It will also send preset notifications that tell the user to drink water and other messages to take care of themselves.
Instead of just a regular list of things to do, there will be some type of animal/pet creature reminding the user about their list of todos. 
By doing preset tasks, like drinking water, the user is rewarded and grow up the pet. 

#### Mood Tracking and Analysis Function: (Developed by Whitney)
The application has 3 sections, the calendar, the statistics and the entry addition. The calendar shows a holistic overview of the user’s mood for the month. 
The dates will be colour coded according to the moods. The statistics will show the data analysis such as a graph of the mood trend, a pie chart of the selected moods. 
The entry addition will allow the user to add information about their day. The information are divided into 2 types, indicators and factors. 
Indicators indicate the user’s status. Indicators include the mood of the day and energy level. Factors indicate what caused the user’s indicators. Factors include sleep duration, medication, place in the menstruation cycle (for female users) and a short note of what made the user feel the way they are.
